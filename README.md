# tidygraph

A tidy-like API for network manipulation with the [igraph](https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph) library inspired by:

-   [tidygraph](https://github.com/thomasp85/tidygraph)
-   [tidygraphtool](https://github.com/jstonge/tidygraphtool/tree/main)

[!IMPORTANT]
> This library is experimental, and updates may be infrequent. Use at your own risk.

## 🧑‍💻 Development

The easiest way to get started with development is through [`nix`](https://nixos.org/) and related ecosystem tools.

I recommend installing nix using either options:

-   [Determinate Nix installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer)
-   [Official Nix installer](https://github.com/NixOS/nix-installer)

> [!NOTE]
> The nix installer provided by the official nix team (since writing, 2026-01-16) is experimental. As a general rule of thumb,
> choose to install from Determinate Nix if you prefer the [additional functionalities](https://determinate.systems/blog/installer-dropping-upstream/)
> provided by the Determinate Nix team, otherwise, use the experimental installer for upstream.

Additionally you will need [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) and [`nix-direnv`](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv?tab=readme-ov-file).

Most (if not all) `nix` development workflow use direnv to auto-load the nix shell environment.

The main editor of choice is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Recommended extensions are included in the [workspace](./tidygraph.code-workspace) file.

If everything is set up correctly, the environment should just work!

### 🚑️ FAQs

#### Nix, Python, and VSCode

Unfortunately VSCode does not have a programmatic way to set which python interpreter to use. Because the python environment is managed by nix, and nix installs/builds
packages in a non-standard location, VSCode can not auto-detect where your packages are.

You will need to update the python interpreter path whenever your nix shell environment updates.

The easiest way to do this is the following:

```sh
# print the python interpreter you are currently tracking
which python
```

The path should look something like `/nix/store/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-venv/bin/python`. This is the python virtual environment generated by `pyproject-nix` and `uv2nix`.

Update the interpreter path in VSCode's python language settings.

> [!TIP]
> You can find the modal quickly using the command palette and searching `Python: Select Interpreter`.

## TODO

-   Consider supporting other graph backends
